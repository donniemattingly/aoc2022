  Performs a breadth first search starting at `node` The neighbors for `node` are determined
  by `neighbors_fn`

  From wikipedia, a BFS is:

      1  procedure BFS(G,start_v):
      2      let Q be a queue
      3      label start_v as discovered
      4      Q.enqueue(start_v)
      5      while Q is not empty
      6          v = Q.dequeue()
      7          if v is the goal:
      8              return v
      9          for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
      10             if w is not labeled as discovered:
      11                 label w as discovered
      12                 w.parent = v
      13                 Q.enqueue(w)

  but the challenge is to accomplish this w/ recursion

  The data structures we'll need to keep around are a queue, a map of discovered nodes, the current path

  We can overload the last two as a single map, with the map being from node -> parent, where existing in
  the map indicates a node is discovered. The initial node with have a value of :start to indicate it has no parent

  We'll also take a function of v to return edges
